            I am an ISP interested in partnering with Netflix to increase the quality of experience for our joint customers. What should I do next?</h3>
            <p>Review the information about our<span class="bold"> engagement process</span> and follow the steps that are described there.</p>
            <h3>How do you compute the numbers used in the <span class="bold">ISP Speed Index?</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Speed Index ratings reflect the average performance during prime time (three busiest hours in the local region). The <br>average is well below the peak performance due to many factors including the variety of encodes we use to deliver the <br>  shows and movies we carry as well as home Wi-Fi and the variety of devices our members use. Those factors cancel <br>out when comparing across ISPs, so these relative rankings are a good indicator of the consistent performance typically   <br> experienced across all users on an ISP network. More information at: <span class="bold"> https://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/about/</span>

            </p>
            <h3>How can I determine which servers Netflix video and image traffic is coming from?
            </h3>
            <p>Netflix clients interact with multiple network destinations to request and deliver content to members. ISPs should <br> contact their Open Connect Partner Engagement Manager (PEM) for assistance with network activities.
